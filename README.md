Now for some random entertainment from the ancient archives: Below is an animated space shuttle launch written in OpenGL back in 1998. This was created for a small group assignment in a Computer Graphics course at the University of Central Florida, as part of the Computer Engineering bachelors degree. Screen recorded and converted to animated GIF.
